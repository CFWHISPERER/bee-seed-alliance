> **Bees and seeds are inextricably entwined**: without seeds to grow plants, there would be little nectar or pollen. Without bees to pollinate plants, there would be few seeds, if any.

- A **gallery of pollinators, seeds, and forage plants**.
- Tools and resources for creating **pollinator-friendly gardens**.
